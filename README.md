# WhatsApp-Spam-Script
This repository contains the script to send a for a given number of times message on Whatsapp Web

### Disclaimer
I made it just for fun and as a bit of challenge to myself. I am not responsible what the user does with it. Use 
it on your own risk. My suggestion is DO NOT test it randomly. You wanna have fun with it? have fun with those people 
who are ok and allow you to do that. 

### How to use
First, let's make it clear that it only works on Whatsapp Web.
Open the whatsapp web, Access the developer tools on your browser. For Chrome, it's Ctrl+Shift+i
Go to "Console" tab 
Copy the script from ``Ultimate_WhatsApp_Spam_Refactored_DEV`` OR ``Ultimate_WhatsApp_Spam_Refactored_Min``. Both files
contain same code. ``Ultimate_WhatsApp_Spam_Refactored_Min`` just contains the code in minified form.
Bang 'Enter" once you have pasted script in console tab.

## Retirement Update
I have carried on this script from its very basic code only version to GUI version for about 2yrs. However, soon (approximately 2-3 months) after making it open source, WhatsApp implemented a DOM Integrity based mechanism which simply discards/ignores any modifications to the dom by the script. I have tried to look into the topic but haven't found anything that would help me. If you know about this stuff, please reach out to me and we can find out a way to bring it back to life.

Until then, Rest in Peace!
